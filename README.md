# Duo-Tournament-Seed-Finders
 
Every seed generated will have a fortress at 64, 64 (Chunk 4,4)
The seeds chosen by Antoine will likely have the fortress visible on nether entry, so this fact shouldn't matter.

Here are the types of seeds and exactly where everything can spawn:

The savillage and temple seeds will contain:
- A savanna village from coordinates (0,0) to (112,112) (the first 7x7 chunks of the world).
- A temple within 3 chunks of that village's starting point.

The tundra village and igloo seeds will contain:
- A tundra village from coordinates (0,0) to (112,112) (the first 7x7 chunks of the world).
- An igloo within 3 chunks of that village's starting point.

The plains village and dark forest seeds will contain:
- A plains village from coordinates (0,0) to (112,112) (the first 7x7 chunks of the world).
- A dark forest within 3 chunks of that village's starting point.
